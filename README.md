# Personal Code Challenge Respository

## Purpose:
This repo is made to keep track of various code challenges that I've worked on. It will serve as a reference to how to tackle problems and data structures. This is not a program that runs and creates output.

## Structure:
Each folder represents a different code challenge. It will contain at least one working solution file inside and a .md or .txt file that has the link to the original source of the code challenge.
